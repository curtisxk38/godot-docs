Documentation and localisation guidelines
=========================================

This page describes the rules to follow if you want to contribute Godot
Engine by writing documentation or translating existing documentation.

Contribute
----------------------

Creating/Updating a documentation page or tutorial page is done via the `github repo <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_.
The README file contains all the information you need to get you started.

What is a good documentation?
-----------------------------

A good documentation is well written in plain English and well-formed
sentences. It is clear and objective.

A documentation page is not a tutorial page. We differentiate these
concepts by these definitions :

-  tutorial : a page aiming at explaining how to use one or more
   concepts in Godot Editor in order to achieve a specific goal with a
   learning purpose (ie. "make a simple 2d Pong game", "apply forces to
   an object"...)
-  documentation : a page describing precisely one and only one concept
   at the time, if possible exhaustively (ie. the list of methods of the
   Sprite class for example).

You are free to write the kind of documentation you wish, as long as you
respect the following rules (and the ones on the repo).

Titles
------

Always begin pages with their title and a Sphinx reference name:

::

    .. _doc_insert_your_title_here:

    Insert your title here
    ======================

Also, avoid American CamelCase titles: title's first word should begin
with a capitalized letter, and every following word should not. Thus,
this is a good example:

-  Insert your title here

And this is a bad example:

-  Insert Your Title Here

Only project names (and people names) should have capitalized first
letter. This is good:

-  Starting up with Godot Engine

And this is bad:

-  Starting up with godot engine

Translating existing pages
--------------------------

For the moment, only English documentation is supported. So localization is not possible right now.
But please be patient, we are working on it ;) (`see issue #4 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/4>`_)

**Remember** : even if Godot aims at being accessible to everyone, English is the most frequent language for documentation.

Important changes and discussions
---------------------------------

You are welcome to correct mistakes or styles to respect these
guidelines. However, in case of important changes: Use the forum, create a new topic with a link
to the incriminated page and start discussing there about your remarks.
